Package: EpiDISH
Title: Epigenetic Dissection of Intra-Sample-Heterogeneity
Version: 2.1.0
Description: EpiDISH is a R package to infer the proportions of a
        priori known cell subtypes present in a sample representing a
        mixture of such cell-types. And it also provides a method that allows 
        the identification of differentially methylated cell-types and their 
        directionality of change.
